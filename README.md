This repo holds tests of SSE models with fossil tips and sampled ancestor trees. Need to improve this README in the future.

## BiSSE - 100 reps (now in low_sample_size directory)
Ran with revbayes development available on 03/01/2023
Min ESS ~166, all reps showing ESS values < 200 (coda) were checked on Tracer (which is a bit less strict) and showed good convergence.

## HiSSE - 100 reps (now in low_sample_size directory)
Ran with revbayes development available at 4:16PM CT, 04/06/2023
Interrupted midway because of rerunning of the simulation reps for higher sample size and revamping of pipelines.

## HiSSE - 500 reps, includes BiSSE
